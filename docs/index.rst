Welcome to pynghttp2's documentation!
=====================================

pynghttp2 are simple asyncio Python bindings based on ctypes for the nghttp2_
library. The only thing you need is a ``libnghttp2`` version on your system.

The project was created in the context of a student work for an HTTP/2 protocol
gateway in the µPCN_ project - an implementation of Delay-tolerant Networking
(DTN) protocols.
